# Bank_Loan_Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to gain insights into loan performance, customer behavior, and risk assessment. The analysis utilizes SQL for querying the data and Power BI for visualizing the results. By exploring the loan datasets, we aim to identify patterns, trends, and key factors influencing loan outcomes.

## Project Structure

- `data`: This directory contains the bank loan datasets used for the analysis.
- `sql_queries.sql`: Contains SQL queries for extracting, transforming, and aggregating data from the bank loan datasets.
- `bank_loan_analysis.pbix`: Power BI file with interactive dashboards and visualizations showcasing the analyzed loan data.
